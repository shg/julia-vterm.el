* julia-vterm

Julia-vterm provides a major-mode for inferior Julia process that runs in vterm, and a minor-mode that extends julia-mode with the ability to interact with the inferior Julia process.

** Should I use this?

There's [[https://github.com/tpapp/julia-repl][julia-repl]]. But it had a display performance issue due to the limited performance of its backend terminal emulator, term.el. That's the reason why I made julia-vterm. Actually, julia-repl seems to have added support for vterm in January 2021, so I think one doesn't need to choose julia-vterm for display performance now.

Another possible reason might be Org Babel support by [[https://github.com/shg/ob-julia-vterm.el][ob-julia-vterm]]. It is still under development but you might be interested.

Currently, julia-vterm offers minimum functionalities for basic interaction with the REPL. A few more functions may be added in the future, but you may want to check julia-repl if you need more features. If the simplicity of this package fits your preference, please give it a try!

** Installation

Just install it from MELPA. The package name is =julia-vterm=.

Then, evaluate the following add-hook line to turn on julia-vterm-mode in newly opened julia-mode buffers. A symbol "‚ÅÇ" in the mode line indicates that the julia-mode buffer is ready to interact with the vterm-powered Julia REPL. Add this line to your init file to enable julia-vterm-mode in future sessions.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'julia-mode-hook #'julia-vterm-mode)
#+END_SRC

You can install the package manually if necessary. First make sure [[https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-emacs][julia-mode]] and [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][emacs-libvterm]] are installed and working properly. Download =julia-vterm.el= into somewhere in your local directory and install it with the following. You also need to configure the hook described above.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package-install-file "/path-to-download-dir/julia-vterm.el")
#+END_SRC

=julia-vterm= will assume your julia executable is just =julia=, if you want to specify a different path, put

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq julia-vterm-repl-program "path/to/julia")
#+END_SRC

** How to use

In a julia script buffer with =julia-vterm-mode= on, you can open an inferior Julia REPL buffer with =M-x julia-vterm-switch-to-repl-buffer= (or =C-c C-z=).
